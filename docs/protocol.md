# Pi Postbox protocol overview

All process-boundary payloads are defined in `@pi-postbox/protocol` and validated with Zod. Clients should ignore unknown fields and preserve stable ids where provided. Schemas intentionally allow generous interviewer context, but still enforce finite string, option, icon, HTTP body, and WebSocket frame limits so a single ask cannot grow without bound.

## HTTP endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /healthz` | Health/status check for wrappers, smoke tests, and operators. May include optional `localTarget` identity for active-local routing. |
| `GET /` | Built Svelte UI shell served by `pi-postbox-server`. |
| `GET /api/state` | Current state snapshot: sessions plus current/terminal ask request snapshots. |
| `GET /api/state/events` | SSE stream. Sends an initial `state` event, then validated state snapshots after changes. |
| `GET /api/requests` | Request list, optionally filtered with `?status=pending|answered|cancelled|expired`. |
| `POST /api/requests/:requestId/answer` | Browser/user answer action. First pending answer wins. |
| `POST /api/requests/:requestId/cancel` | Browser/user cancel action. |
| `POST /api/requests/:requestId/chat` | Activate or reattach to the extension-owned exact private Question Chat fork. Source-path/leaf failures disclose typed context-only fallback availability. |
| `POST /api/requests/:requestId/chat/context` | Explicitly start or reattach to an eligible context-only Chat. Requires JSON `{ "confirmed": true }`; it is never called automatically. |
| `GET /api/requests/:requestId/chat` | Fetch the current normalized Question Chat snapshot. |
| `POST /api/requests/:requestId/chat/messages` | Send an idle prompt or steer the active turn, using a stable browser command id. |
| `POST /api/requests/:requestId/chat/stop` | Abort only the active Question Chat turn, using a stable browser command id. |
| `GET /api/requests/:requestId/chat/events` | Stream normalized Question Chat lifecycle/message events plus transient online/offline transport state over SSE. |
| `POST /api/machines/:machineId/rename` | Persist dashboard-side machine alias. |
| `POST /api/projects/:projectId/rename` | Persist dashboard-side project alias. |
| `GET /api/history` | Recent terminal decision history. |
| `POST /api/history/prune` | Apply configured terminal-history retention. |
| `POST /admin/shutdown` | Gracefully stop the server. Loopback-only: rejected (403) unless the request comes straight from `127.0.0.1`/`::1` with no proxy-forwarding headers, so it is unreachable through Tailscale/lizardtail. Returns `202` then closes the app and exits. Used by `npm run dev` to stop a production server holding the canonical port. |

## Question Chat browser and relay protocol

The browser activates exact Chat with `POST /api/requests/:requestId/chat`, or makes a separate confirmed `POST /api/requests/:requestId/chat/context` request for context-only fallback. Activation and `GET /api/requests/:requestId/chat` return the initial normalized snapshot. The browser then subscribes to `GET /api/requests/:requestId/chat/events` for incremental lifecycle, message, tool, and online/offline transport events. The stream begins with a connection comment; it does not replay a private transcript, so clients resynchronize from a fresh snapshot if a runtime sequence has a gap.

Messages use `POST /api/requests/:requestId/chat/messages` with `{ "clientCommandId": "...", "message": "..." }`; Stop uses `POST /api/requests/:requestId/chat/stop` with the same bounded `clientCommandId` shape. The id makes retries idempotent. An accepted send returns `mode: "prompt" | "steer"`; commands are rejected while the extension is offline rather than queued.

Every correlated server-to-extension request/response command has a relay `requestId`; one-way notifications such as `chat.cleanup` do not require one. The extension response must carry that matching correlation id, and Chat payloads also carry the owning Postbox Question id. The principal command/result pairs are:

| Server command | Extension result |
| --- | --- |
| `chat.activate` or `chat.activate-context` | `chat.ready` or `chat.error` |
| `chat.snapshot` | `chat.snapshot` or `chat.error` |
| `chat.send` | `chat.send.accepted` or `chat.error` |
| `chat.stop` | `chat.stop.accepted` or `chat.error` |
| `chat.propose-answer.result` | Result for extension-originated `chat.propose-answer` |
| `chat.reconcile` | `chat.reconciled`, followed by `chat.recover.complete` after accepted recovery |

The extension emits sequenced visible `chat.event` frames independently of command acknowledgements. Terminal resolution or authoritative owner reconciliation sends `chat.cleanup`. On reconnect, the extension offers only owner metadata with `chat.recover.offer`; the server answers `chat.reconcile` with a correlated recover/delete disposition. Private snapshots transferred during recovery remain transient.

Public Chat failures use the structured error codes `forbidden_origin`, `rate_limited`, `duplicate_command`, `wrong_owner`, `request_not_pending`, `extension_offline`, and `command_timeout` (along with the source/context/runtime codes defined by `QuestionChatAvailabilityCodeSchema`). HTTP status distinguishes origin, throttling, missing/terminal requests, and unavailable extension/timeout cases; the JSON body remains `{ "status": "unavailable", "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." } }`, with `retryAfterMs` or `contextFallback` when applicable.

Context-only commands are created only from the stored Question, all options, required non-blank `codebaseContext` and `problemContext`, bounded optional handoff details, owning session cwd, and optional recorded model. Browser-supplied interviewer context is ignored. A successful proposed answer is appended as an option with authoritative `provenance: "chat"`; proposal does not select or resolve the Question.

## Health active-local identity

`/healthz` always reports basic service health and may include optional `localTarget` when the server has published active-local metadata. That identity contains `role`, `instanceId`, and normalized `url`.

Active-local metadata candidates require an exact identity match: the candidate role, instance id, and URL must match `/healthz.localTarget` exactly before the extension trusts the target. Missing or mismatched identity is treated as a health mismatch. This keeps stale or unsafe metadata from redirecting clients to an unrelated loopback server.

## Extension WebSocket

The Pi extension connects outbound to:

```text
/api/extension/ws
```

Client messages:

- `session.register` — machine/project/session metadata and generated machine id.
- `heartbeat` — keeps the session live and can carry semantic state.
- `session.update` — semantic/title/cwd/branch updates.
- `session.shutdown` — releases a session and marks it offline. It may include `reason: "quit" | "reload" | "new" | "resume" | "fork"`; replacement/quit reasons cancel that session's pending asks, while `reload` is treated as a reconnect path and does not cancel pending asks.
- `ask.create` — creates or replays an idempotent pending request by `requestId`.
- `ask.answer` — reconciles a local terminal fallback answer.
- `ask.cancel` — reconciles a local terminal fallback cancellation.
- `chat.ready`, `chat.snapshot`, `chat.send.accepted`, and `chat.stop.accepted` — correlated Question Chat command results.
- `chat.event` — normalized visible Question Chat lifecycle/message output; private reasoning and tool traffic never cross this boundary.
- `chat.recover.offer`, `chat.reconciled`, and `chat.recover.complete` — a one-manifest-at-a-time, correlated reconnect protocol. The extension offers private metadata only; a recovered full snapshot is transient and is never stored by the server.

Server messages:

- `registered` — registration accepted.
- `ack` — heartbeat/session update/shutdown accepted.
- `ask.created` — pending ask card exists.
- `ask.resolved` — ask reached a terminal `answered`, `cancelled`, `expired`, or `unavailable` result.
- `error` — validation or transition error.
- `chat.activate` — activate or reattach to an exact private fork at the recorded source leaf.
- `chat.activate-context` — distinctly activate or reattach to a fresh private context-only interviewer from authoritative persisted Question, option, and handoff context. It carries cwd and an optional recorded model, but never a source path, leaf, or transcript.
- `chat.snapshot`, `chat.send`, `chat.stop`, and `chat.cleanup` — owner-scoped commands shared by exact and context-only private Question Chat runtimes.
- `chat.reconcile` — the server-authoritative `recover`/`delete` disposition for one offered manifest. Recovery requires the registered socket, pending request owner, request id, and fork kind to agree; missing, terminal, and wrong-owner manifests are deleted.

## Question Chat activation and context-only fallback

Question Chat snapshots identify their runtime with `forkKind: "exact" | "context-only"`. A ready response whose kind does not match the requested activation is rejected. Repeated activation of the same kind reattaches idempotently; an activation of the other kind cannot replace a running runtime.

Exact activation remains the primary path. When it fails with `source_path_missing` or `source_leaf_missing`, the HTTP error includes a finite `contextFallback` object:

- `{ "status": "available" }` means both persisted `codebaseContext` and `problemContext` are present.
- `{ "status": "unavailable", "reason": "missing_codebase_context" | "missing_problem_context" | "missing_codebase_and_problem_context" }` gives the precise legacy-data reason.

The server never converts an exact activation into context-only activation. The browser must separately disclose that context-only Chat is a fresh private interviewer based on persisted handoff context, obtain confirmation, and then send `{ "confirmed": true }` to the context endpoint. An explicit ineligible start returns `context_fallback_unavailable` with the typed unavailable reason. The server builds the extension command from the stored authoritative Question, every option, required handoff context, bounded optional `additionalInfo`, session cwd, and `forkReference.model` when present; browser-provided context and source conversation history are not accepted.

Historical Questions that lack either required context field remain readable and may still use exact activation while their recorded source exists. They cannot use context-only fallback.

## Question Chat turn lifecycle

Question Chat snapshots and events use `ready`, `generating`, `stopping`, `stopped`, and `interrupted` states. A message sent while `ready` starts an ordinary SDK prompt. A message accepted while `generating` uses Pi's `streamingBehavior: "steer"` path and returns `mode: "steer"`; it is not queued as a follow-up turn.

Stop aborts the active SDK operation without disposing the private runtime. Visible partial assistant output remains in the transcript with a `stopped` marker, the lifecycle passes through `stopping` and `stopped`, and the runtime returns to `ready`. A retry-exhausted SDK error similarly preserves the last visible partial with an `interrupted` marker before returning to `ready`; retryable attempts are not marked interrupted prematurely. Replayed send and Stop commands are idempotent by their bounded `clientCommandId`.

The private Pi fork remains the only Chat transcript. A versioned `0600` manifest in a hash-keyed `0700` directory records the owning session, fork kind, private session path, transcript boundary, model metadata, and durable sequence high-water mark. `/reload` aborts/disposes the old SDK runtime but preserves this fork; replacement, quit, terminal resolution, invalid metadata, and authoritative reconciliation deletion remove it. Runtime sequence is persisted before an event is emitted so a crash cannot reuse a number.

Question Chat enables exactly four custom repository-evidence tools: literal, bounded equivalents of read, grep, find, and list. Pi builtin tools, shell, mutation tools, and extension-provided tools are excluded. Each activation and recovery rediscovers the containing Git worktree for the recorded cwd, or uses the cwd subtree outside Git. Paths are schema-validated, normalized, containment-checked component by component, screened for ignored and secret-like names, and opened/traversed with finite byte, match, entry, depth, operation-time, and browser-output limits. Directory symlinks are never traversed. Tool activity is normalized into bounded running/success/error/stale rows; completed rows reconstruct from the private fork after reload, while a crash-interrupted running row becomes stale.

Browser snapshots are extension-backed. A fresh browser sees `extension_offline` when the extension cannot supply one. An already-open browser preserves its rendered snapshot during an outage, marks it offline/stale, disables commands, and requires Retry. Runtime events are monotonic; a gap causes a fresh snapshot resynchronization. Transient transport frames have no runtime sequence and are not transcript data. Expandable tool details render as bounded plain text, never raw HTML. The server never queues Chat commands while the extension is offline and never stores Chat snapshots, messages, or tool activity in SQLite.

## Ask lifecycle

1. Pi calls `ask_postbox`.
2. Extension sends `ask.create` with a stable `requestId`.
3. Server stores a pending request and broadcasts state over SSE.
4. Browser or local terminal fallback submits an answer/cancel.
5. Server stores a terminal result and broadcasts state.
6. Extension receives `ask.resolved` and returns a concise result to the coding agent.

Replayed `ask.create` messages with the same `requestId` are idempotent. If the request is still pending, the server returns `ask.created`; if it is already terminal, the server returns `ask.resolved`.

## Status and browser command boundaries

The `/postbox-status` user command and read-only `postbox_status` tool expose privacy-preserving operational status: connection state, active/local URL when known, Tailnet/export guidance when available, open-question count, autostart state, and diagnostics. They do not expose pending question contents, options, answers, notes, or history.

The `/postbox` user command opens the active dashboard in the user's browser, using recovery/autostart if needed. Browser-opening is user-only/manual behavior and is not exposed through an LLM tool or agent side effect.

## Rich context and result hygiene

Every new ask request must include a `context` object with non-blank `codebaseContext` and `problemContext`. It may also include:

- question context, relevance, and decision impact
- per-option meaning/context
- additional text/code/diagram/link items
- fork references such as agent session id/path and leaf id

The dashboard APIs expose this context for display/history/interviewer use. The `ask_postbox` tool result intentionally returns only final selected values, user note, concise rationale/status metadata, request id, and resolved timestamp.

## Semantic and presence state

Semantic state is reported by the extension:

- `working`
- `blocked`
- `idle`
- `unknown`

A Pi session replacement (`/new`, `/resume`, `/fork`) is a semantic boundary: the old Postbox session is explicitly shut down and unresolved asks for that session are cancelled with a lifecycle rationale. A Pi `/reload` is not a semantic boundary; pending asks remain attached to the same session and the replacement extension runtime can reconnect/re-register.

Presence is derived by the server from WebSocket connection and heartbeat timing:

- `live`
- `stale`
- `offline`

`ask_postbox` waits explicitly mark semantic state as blocked/waiting. Observed local `ask_user` calls also mark blocked. Herdr-compatible blocked events are best-effort; Postbox does not depend on Herdr.

## Active-local client routing compatibility

Active-local routing has no broad discovery and performs no port scanning. Clients read only `active-local/dev.json` and `active-local/production.json` from the configured Postbox base, prefer dev over production while fresh and healthy, and use production fallback when dev is stale or unhealthy.

Effective env-over-config precedence is preserved. A configured `PI_POSTBOX_URL` or configured Tailscale/hosted URL is a preferred Postbox server. The client verifies preferred-server health first; when healthy, the preferred target is authoritative for that registration. If the preferred server is unreachable or unavailable, clients may use local fallback through health-verified active-local metadata or package-local autostart. Remote URLs themselves are not local recovery candidates; metadata and autostart are the recovery paths. Missing or loopback config can use health-verified metadata; a configured loopback fallback is also health-verified.

For active-local sessions, live retargeting may move a running client to a newly selected local target when safe. Sent asks and local fallback resolutions pin their origin until resolved, flushed, expired, or released by a bounded target-affinity deadline; while pinned, clients may report deferred switching. A session that has registered with a fallback/autostarted server is sticky and remains attached until `/reload` or restart rather than polling back to a recovered preferred server mid-session.

Package-local autostart is a client recovery behavior for `ask_postbox` and the user-only `/postbox` command. It can be disabled with `PI_POSTBOX_AUTOSTART=off`; `PI_POSTBOX_AUTOSTART_TIMEOUT_MS` sets the wait time and defaults to 10 seconds (`10000` ms).

## Compatibility notes

- Treat `requestId`, `sessionId`, `machineId`, and `projectId` as stable protocol identifiers.
- Handle unknown fields gracefully.
- Use `/healthz` to confirm service and protocol version before relying on newer fields.
- `contextFallback`, `forkKind: "context-only"`, `POST .../chat/context`, and `chat.activate-context` are additive Question Chat capabilities that require a server and extension version that both understand them. Older Questions without complete persisted context deliberately report fallback unavailable; they are not migrated by inventing context.
- V1 has no app-level authentication; restrict network reachability with Tailscale/lizardtail or an external auth proxy.
- State-changing HTTP actions and extension WebSockets reject cross-origin browser requests unless the `Origin` host matches the Postbox service host. Node/Pi extension clients normally omit `Origin` and are accepted if they can reach the service.
